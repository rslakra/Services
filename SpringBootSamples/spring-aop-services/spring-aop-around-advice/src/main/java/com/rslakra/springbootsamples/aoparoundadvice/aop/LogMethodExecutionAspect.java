     * Create our pointcut and advice.
     * <p>
     * Our pointcut just says, â€˜Apply this advice any method which is annotated with @LogMethodExecutionTime.'
     * <p>
     * The method logMethodExecutionTime() itself is our advice. There is a single argument, ProceedingJoinPoint. In our
     * case, this will be an executing method which has been annotated with @LogMethodExecutionTime.
     * <p>
     * Finally, when our annotated method ends up being called, what will happen is our advice will be called first.
     * Then it's up to our advice to decide what to do next. In our case, our advice is doing nothing other than calling
     * proceed(), which is the just calling the original annotated method.
     * <p>
     * Again, we've not done anything that's particularly complicated here. We've just recorded the current time,
     * executed the method, then printed the amount of time it took to the console. We're also logging the method
     * signature, which is provided to use the joinpoint instance. We would also be able to gain access to other bits of
     * information if we wanted to, such as method arguments.
     *
