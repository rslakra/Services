POST: 201 Created
PATCH: 200 OK
DELETE: 204 No Content

201 Created, 
202 Accepted
```

I find 202 Accepted to be a very handy alternative to 201 Created.

It basically means:
> I, the server, have understood your request. I have not created the resource (yet), but that is fine.

There are two main scenarios which I find 202 Accepted to be especially suitable:
- If the resource will be created as a result of future processing â€” example: After a job/process has finished.
- If the resource already existed in some way, but this should not be interpreted as an error.

## 400
```text
401 Unauthorized, and 
403 Forbidden
```

#### 401 vs 403

- Has the consumer not provided authentication credentials? Was their SSO Token invalid/timed out? ðŸ‘‰ 401 Unauthorized.

- Was the consumer correctly authenticated, but they donâ€™t have the required permissions/proper clearance to access the resource? ðŸ‘‰ 403 Forbidden.
