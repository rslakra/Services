To manage external link details dynamically, you can create a webpage that allows users to add, edit, and organize external links. Here's how you can implement this functionality:

**Content Management System (CMS)**

Use a CMS to create and manage dynamic pages for external links. This approach allows you to:

Create a dynamic list page to display all external links

Implement dynamic item pages for individual link details

Link elements on your site to these dynamic pages

**Web Link Management**


Implement a web link management system with the following features:

Web Link Sets: Create sets to organize links by category or purpose

**Individual Web Links: For each link, include:**

- Name (title of the link)
- External URL
- Description
- Publishing state (draft/published)
- Display order
- SEO settings (e.g., robots follow link)

**User Interface**

Design a user-friendly interface for managing links:

- Add New Link: Create a form with fields for link details
- Edit Existing Links: Allow users to modify link information
- Organize Links: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for ordering links
- Preview: Show how links will appear on the website

**Dynamic URL Handling**

Ensure proper handling of dynamic URLs:

Validate external URLs to ensure they are correctly formatted

Implement error handling for broken or invalid links

Consider using a URL shortener service for cleaner link management

**Additional Features**

Open in New Tab: Add an option to open external links in a new tab

Link Tracking: Implement analytics to track link clicks and performance

Automatic Link Checking: Periodically verify the validity of external links

By implementing these features, you can create a dynamic webpage that efficiently manages external link details, providing a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and organizing links on your website.
