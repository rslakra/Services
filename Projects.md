## Projects to try on your own

---

Once you are familiar with the language syntax and are comfortable completing exercises and practice problems, you can start working toward taking on your own projects.
Doing so will be excellent practice and can help you build a professional portfolio!

**Below, we’ve listed a few tasks you can try.**

| Project                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| URL Shortener             | Managing lengthy or unruly URLs can be a pain, so URL shorteners are terrific resources that make URLs look more appealing without detracting from their functionality. You can use Python to create your own URL shortening program.                                                                                                                                            |
| Text-Based Adventure Game | While somewhat simple, this project is one of the most exciting beginner-level challenges new Python coders can try. Essentially, you create an adventure game that solely uses text to facilitate movement and action. With this project, be sure to include movement restrictions and a tracker to track user movement through the settings you create, as consistency is key. |
| Random Password Generator | Strong, unique passwords are crucial for online security. A random password generator that takes input from users and generates secure passwords from that data is a productive and worthwhile Python project to tackle.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Digital Post-It Notes     | Creating a virtual version of sticky notes to track miscellaneous thoughts and agenda items is a great intermediate Python project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Typing Speed Test         | This project aims to create a program that calculates a user’s typing speed. The program could also display speed, accuracy and words per minute (WPM). You can use web-based source code for typing test programs online to make this project more efficient.                                                                                                                   |
| Expense Tracker           | This project uses Python libraries like Panda or Matplotlib to create a software application that allows users to track their expenses and develop insights into their spending or saving habits.                                                                                                                                                                                |
